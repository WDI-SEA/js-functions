/*BONUS
letterCount(word)
Write a function that takes a string that finds out how many times a character occurs. For example, the string "apple" would print the following:

a - 1
p - 2
l - 1
e - 1

Hint: There are two parts to this question.

The first is determining the counts of each letter. To do that, loop through each letter, and increment the value to a key in an object. The key should be the letter, the value is the number of times that the letter was encountered. For example { 'a': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1 }.

The second is then printing out the keys and values inside that object. How can you loop through the keys in an object?

upper case letters count for the same character. Also, ignore spaces and
punctuation.*/
